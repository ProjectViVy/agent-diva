# TODOLIST

This file is the project-level backlog for bugs, gaps, and unfinished work found during development or review.

## Done

- [x] Improve GUI image input experience for multimodal vision.
  - Context: The current image recognition path supports image file attachments, but direct clipboard image paste in the GUI composer is not implemented.
  - Expected boundary: This is a planned GUI/product optimization, not a backend vision-chain failure.
  - Target behavior: Pasted clipboard images should be captured, uploaded through the existing file attachment path, displayed as an image chip or preview, and handled consistently with model vision capability checks.
  - Related docs: `docs/logs/2026-06-multimodal-gui-boundary/v0.0.8-gui-paste-boundary/summary.md`
  - **Closed**: Implemented in `53bc086 feat(gui): add clipboard image paste support in composer`. All target behaviors covered: clipboard capture via `handlePaste`, upload through existing `uploadFile` API, image preview via attachments UI, multi-image support.
